## Editor Script
This script adds a menu option to the context menu on a gui scene. When used it creates a collection and a gui_script (which adds the "require monarch" and "acquire_input_focus" automatically). It also adds the gui_script to the selected gui scene and adds the gui scene to the newly created collection.
